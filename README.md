# CodeNation Master Bootcamp Week 1
 A summary of the lessons taught on week 1 of the Codenation Master Course. 
 The course was taught using camelCase, though I have elected to maintain my use of snake_case for variables in order to ensure that my code is consistent with itself, and use camelCase for function names to maintain consistency with JavaScript.

## Day 1 - dotNotation

## Day 2 - Variables, If Else Switch
 
## Day 3 - Arrays and Loops

## Day 4 Functions, Objects
